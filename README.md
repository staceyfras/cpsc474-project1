### Notes for Usage
1. The program asks for the input file to test and asks for the name of the output file ...
2. Values in each row should be separated by a _space_ followed by an endline (_enter_).
3. To test each algorithm, please use the following lines of code within the current directory of this project:
    --> calculate algorithm:
        ``` python3 project1_calculate.py ```
    --> 
       ``` python3 project1_verify.py ``` 
 4. The program will automatically print the results to a file _out.txt_ within the current directory of this project.
